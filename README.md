This is some code together for the Adafruit Thermal Printer Guts that allows for using all of the fuctions of the thermal printer from a python file that can be called for services like NodeRED and n8n

The main files needed for this to work is the Thermal Printer Lib (Adafruit_Thermal.py) and the printer script (printer.py)
